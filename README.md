# belly-button-challenge

For this challenge, I used in class resources as well as help from a few other students. The html contains the page layout, included title. For the .js file, I pulled the json link provided then stored it using d3.json to call later. The following contains the functions to create the three graphs used: bar, bubble, and gauge. Then the dropdown function with the metadata is used to create a dropdown menu to look at different sections of data by name/individual.

For the newest edit, I added the dropdown to the biginning and initialized the page first, then created the charts, then updated the guage function. This seemed to make it work much better.
